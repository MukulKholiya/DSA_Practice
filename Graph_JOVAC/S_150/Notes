In adjacency matrix , there is loss of space complexity for holding non neighbour vertices i.e (i,j)=0
In adjacency list searching of connection between two vertices takes O(n) time  complexity.
To overcome both problems, we came up with HashMap as a solution.
Hashmap<Integer,Hashmap<Integer,Integer>> our structure for Graph.
Complete Graph : Every vertex connected with each and every vertex. Total vertices = n(n-1)/2 .

5 important steps for graphs:-

1.) remove
2.) ignore
3.) mark visited
4.) self work
5.) add visited
